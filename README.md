# MethodQ
The extremely simple and light solution to time management problems in 
generic C# projects (for when [Quartz.NET](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet) is just overkill). You can queue 
any method call (System.Action) for invocation in the future (repeating 
or non-repeating). 

The only requirement is support for the .NET Standard 2.0
